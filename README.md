# Movies-Reactjs

This is just frodend-part in the project. I got the idea from Neflix and another movies pages. I stop with small components which is not prefect now. 
The part i will list in the below:
  - Login and register 
  - Page movies with map and filter for searching name and day with match with local data storage
  - The page get free or need paid to watch movies.
 Everything is not connected with API yet. But you can see bunch of stuff with ES6, if you got passion with REACTJS, i hope you can see and get ideas for yourself to make your project prefect. 
If you newbie, you can see how map filter and bunch of functions how it works with list and array in REACTJS and get more knowledge
